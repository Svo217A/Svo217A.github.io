                                AT MIT, I have been involved with various events hosted by the university. 
                                This includes:<br/> - Setting up and guiding participants for the Harvard-MIT Math Tournament (HMMT) - 2017<br/>- Guiding students around campus for the Undergraduate Society of Women in Mathematics (USWIM) math competition, designed to encourage female students to explore STEM - 2017<br/><br/> Science Olympiad (Sci Oly) has been a large part of my high school experience, and I was ecstatic to proctor and grade for the Anatomy & Physiology event for Sci Oly at MIT - 2018 <br/> I also mentored students in the BluePrint Learnathon and Hackathon in February 2018. I helped middle school students through a tutorial of Python and answered their questions while they built their hacks!<br/><a href="https://blueprint.hackmit.org/"><img src="blueprint.png" alt="Blueprint" style="width:250px"></a><br/><br/> The next month, I ran one of the registration desks for Spark, a program that provides engaging challenges and lessons for middle school students in the area - 2018 <br/><br/> I was a mentor for a week-long summer program called DynaMIT. This student run program provides STEM activities and lessons for middle school students who come from low-income backgrounds. As a mentor, I led activities for my group of four students, worked with two students on a Scratch project, and co-led a presentation on Forensics - 2018 <br/><a href="http://dynamit.mit.edu/"><img src="dynamit.png" alt="dynaMIT" style="width:250px"></a>

                                In 2016, I became the Vice President of my school's Mu Alpha Theta (MAO) chapter. Throughout the summer and school year, I helped plan for events such as our annual Fall Festival and the MAO Tournament. I worked with our sponsor, Ms. Lugemwa, and my fellow officers to organize tutoring records for students and other paper work for MAO. <br/> <br/>For all of my years as a MAO member starting in 2014, I tutored fellow students at the Alabama School of Fine Arts (ASFA) in several different subjects: Energy and Matter, Geometry, Algebra, Calculus, and Computer Science. I also volunteered every year for our school's math tournament. I organized, proctored, and scored for the event; I learned several tricks to be more efficient when I worked in the scoring room. I have enjoyed being involved in such a great community at my high school.

                                Outside of Mu Alpha Theta, I helped with other school wide and departmental activities. For three years (2013 - 2015), I mentored incoming students in my department (Math & Science) as a Peer Helper. I introduced them to the school and became a resource for them if they had any questions, transitioning into a unique school. <br/> <br/> For two years, I participated in the Habitat for Humanity group for my school's Make a Difference Day. I installed vinyl siding and painted for two houses, and I helped clean up one of the warehouses located in the Birmingham area. <br/> <br/> From 2014 to 2017, I volunteered to teach middle school students how to program Lego Mindstorm robots for the Math & Science outreach at ASFA. I led groups of 3 to 4 kids and showed them how to code. I also helped present small science experiments for open house, and for another outreach event. During the summer, I was a teacher assistant for week-long summer camps:<br/> -An App Inventor camp that introduces middle school students to drag-and-drop programming (2014)-<br/>-An AP Chemistry camp for rising 10th graders at ASFA since it is one of their first AP courses-<br/>-Boat building and bridge building camps, teaching engineering concepts for middle school students-<br/>
